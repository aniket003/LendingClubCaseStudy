## Analysing Methodology
1. Data Understanding : Working with the Data Dictionary and getting knowledge of all the columns and their domain specific uses .
2. Data Cleaning : Removing the null valued columns, unnecessary variables and checking the null value percentage and removing the respective rows.
3. Univariate Analysis : Analyzing each column, plotting the distributions of each column.
4. Segmented Univariate Analysis : Analyzing the continuous data columns with respect to the categorical column .
5. Bivariate Analysis  : Analyzing the two variables behavior like term and loan status with respect to loan amount.
6. Recommendations : Analyzing all plots and recommendations for reducing the loss of business by detecting columns best which contribute to loan defaulters.

## Technologies Used
1. pandas library for handling datasets
2. numpy library for handling series
3. seaborn library for better graphic graph plots
4. matplotlib library for graph plots

## Conclusions
1. Lending club should reduce the high interest loans for 60 months term, they are more prone to loan default. 
2. Borrowers for small business loans are defaulted the most , Lending club should reduce issuing the loans to them. 
3. Lending club should not lend large amount loans at high interest rate  to people with low annual income .
4. Lending club should reduce number of loans approved for lower DTI ( dept-to-income ratio) 
5. Highest number of defaulters have verification status "Not-verifiedâ€œ but the percentage is highest for "verified" indicating a major flaw in verification process .
